# File Manipulation Program

This program performs file read and write operations with robust error handling. It consists of two main functionalities:

1.  **File Read & Write Challenge:**
    * Reads the contents of an input file.
    * Modifies the content (this can be specified in the code).
    * Writes the modified content to a new output file.

2.  **Error Handling Lab:**
    * Prompts the user to enter a filename.
    * Implements error handling to catch and manage potential issues, such as:
        * File not found.
        * Permission errors during file reading.
        * Any other input output exceptions.

## Usage

1.  Run the program.
2.  When prompted, enter the filename you wish to process.
3.  The program will either:
    * Create a new file with the modified content, or
    * Display an error message if the file cannot be accessed or processed.

## Customization

* The file modification logic can be customized within the code to perform specific transformations (e.g., uppercase conversion, line reversal, etc.).
* Error handling can be further expanded to handle more specific exceptions or provide more detailed error messages.
